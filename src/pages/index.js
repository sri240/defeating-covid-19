        Sitting at home, one might stumble upon the convenient notion of
        helplessness, taking no notice of the potential for change in each and
        every one of us. During this time, positivity is a treasure, and being
        able to share our stories can unite us to defeat COVID-19, together.

            Nothing in this life is simple or one-sided: of course, the same can
            be said for even a global pandemic. As many of us are aware, there
            will be pain and suffering, but where there is a widespread
            difficulty, it is up to us to unite, as humanity, to grow and get
            past it. During this quarantine, I've been able to re-examine how
            I'm spending my time, and build a more healthy lifestyle. I've been
            working out, eating healthier, sleeping more, and making time for
            myself, as opposed to enduring the burn as I chased my speeding
            train of a schedule. I also picked up baking, as if I don't have an
            influx of sugar in the house anyways. I've been able to make time to
            make music, build websites, and write. I picnic in my backyard,
            listen to music and watch Netflix on days I decide to relax (for
            pretty much the first time ever...I know, it's unbelievable, so send
            me good show recommendations). I've been able to get back to dancing
            when I can, and singing all the time, simply because I'm at home for
            most of the day. Listening to the news, I've realized that everyone,
            no matter in how miniscule of a manner, can have an impact on the
            current pandemic, which led me to create Defeating COVID-19.
            <br></br>Climbing the hill may be difficult, but we can together,
            and the view from the summit is the ultimate reward: we can unite,
            share our stories and positivity, and get over this pandemic.

            Surprisingly, I adapted quite well to the pandemic. It reminded me a
            lot of my childhood and wasn't hard for me to adjust to get a new,
            safe routine in place of my old one. With or without school, I’ve
            been taught that it’s always best to keep your mind sharp, focused,
            and developed. I've been making capable use of my time indoors by
            understanding new things, keeping my body physically and mentally
            active, and making apt use of the internet's resources. Some
            accomplishments I'm proud of highlighting include: a new job;
            starting a blog; making new, meaningful connections; and better
            understanding the world around me. Throughout this crisis, I
            established a deeper relationship with my friends; we all shared a
            common struggle but found strength in unity. <br></br>This was the
            perfect opportunity, as a freshman in high school, to reflect on me
            and figure out what my next couple of years in life would be.
            Although I’ve gone through various tragedies, including the death of
            my dog, the key thing I learned was to have a positive outlook and
            continue to remain a beacon of hope for those suffering through
            tragedy and depression. <br></br>2020 has been an unfortunate year,
            but that will not prevent 2021 from repeating the same tragedy. I
            believe that with the right attitude and treatment, the world we
            return to will not be the same, but rather a wake-up call to remain
            proactive and forge the opportunities ahead of us that will shape
            our future.

            As a senior graduating high school, going off to college, and just
            beginning to understand life, COVID has been surprisingly difficult,
            yet interesting to live through. While I found it hard to keep up
            with the sudden barrage of assignments during lockdown, it was
            primarily due to the lack of focus I had (because come on, you're at
            home all the time, you're not going to do schoolwork for eight hours
            a day). Yet that lack of focus brought along new things and an
            influx of time, which though not spent on school, enabled me to
            explore my hobbies significantly more. I was able to make more music
            than I was able to before, I was able to develop the most advanced
            version of Jade, my AI chatbot, and I was able to spend some time
            taking pictures of local things, walking around my neighborhood for
            once. Though I've missed out on a lot of opportunities in my social,
            academic, and professional life because of the pandemic, I won't be
            one to say that the time I've spent at home wasn't productive or
            interesting; quite the oppositeand I hope everyone else out there
            feels that way too. It's tough times, for sure, but we'll all get
            through it; if not somehow, then sometime.

            I've been doing pretty well. I've been doing some things that I
            didn't always have time for before. For example, I've been baking,
            spending more time with family, walking my dog more, and doing some
            crafts. I've also been using the time to study for my SAT and tutor
            people in math. It's also given me some extra time to take care of
            myself: I've been doing home-workouts, eating healthier, and
            sleeping more. Like everything in life, COVID-19 has had some
            positive and negative effects for me. On the positive side, it's
            given me some extra free time and given me a little break from a
            busy schedule. Some of the negative effects include not being able
            to go to school in person, losing in-person contact with others, and
            canceling some events I was looking forward to. I'm starting to get
            bored of staying home, and I'm especially sad that my last year of
            high school won't be in-person. I miss seeing my friends and
            teachers at school, and just getting out of the house more. But,
            even though I missed out on some opportunities, I've still been
            staying optimistic about the future. We're all in the same boat, and
            we'll all get through this together.

            I've been trying to keep myself together, although, admittedly, with
            the combined stress of upcoming exams like SATs, pressure from
            knowing i'm going to college in two years, and generally not being
            able to see the people who made me happy every day at school, it's
            been hard. Having obligations that force me to keep going, like
            classes, helps get me up in the morning. It's definitely been hard
            to keep up a healthy lifestyle in quarantine, but hopefully, it will
            be worth it. I've picked up some old hobbies like dancing, guitar,
            and singing, and I'm relearning them since I have time anyways, I'm
            just trying to make sure I don't spend too much time relaxing nor do
            I work myself until I burn out. Balance is key! And also masks.

            In the past few months I've worked to cofound Break The Outbreak, a
            nonprofit organization that helps combat the pandemic. Besides this,
            the pandemic has had a great effect on my life as a whole. I am an
            avid runner and am on the Cross Country and Track and Field team at
            my high school. Having my season and practice cancelled had a large
            effect on my schedule and what I did as a hobby. However, this
            allowed me to focus on my individual fitness and spend more time on
            my sport because of no school. Losing face to face contact with many
            of my friends was very difficult and using zoom to keep in tough was
            a significant downgrade and something I am still get used to.
            Overall, I am grateful to be in a position where the pandemic and
            lockdown did not really affect me or my family in a severely
            negative way. Still, 2021 could not come fast enough.

            Things have been going at a solid neutral ever since this pandemic
            started. Thankfully my family and I haven’t been financially
            impacted and life is similar to how it was before, just without any
            of us traveling more than necessary. It’s unfortunate that all of
            the spring sports were cut off before the season could get going but
            I understand why. I’ve had more time to myself, and theoretically
            this means I can get things done but all that’s happened is I’ve
            gotten much better at procrastinating. This is in part because I no
            longer have a normal schedule but mostly because I no longer have
            any comprehension of days, weeks, or time. Deadlines and
            appointments drive most of my actions.{" "}

            So far COVID has been an impact on me physically, but mostly
            mentally. At the very beginning of quarantine I had an extremely
            difficult time trying to control my restlessness and anxiety. I had
            some days were I was very mentally unstable and unhappy. However, I
            spent a great deal of time reading and listening to music which
            really helped me get through the tough times! After quarantine was
            lifted, I was able to go out and see my friends again and have fun
            with them, even if it was 6 feet apart. :)

            What I’ve been up to: Nothing much. Just waiting around for college
            to start, while grinding chemistry. In my free time, I grind
            valorant trying to climb to Platinum. I also recently started doing
            more cyber security things like CTF.

            I've been ok, though I'm definitely not getting enough sleep. I've
            just been at home doing review and going on walks occasionally,
            taking pictures and then spending way too much time photoshopping
            lol.

            I haven't been doing anything too fun, but I found an internship
            program that I got through a connection, and that's honestly all
            I've been doing aside from working out.

            I've been doing great! I spend my time playing Minecraft and making
            brownies for myself and my little sister, even though it has
            actually gotten me injured, haha.

            I've been doing fine, I've been learning tricks on my rollerblades
            and I've been writing (Well, staring at a blank screen and calling
            it writing).
