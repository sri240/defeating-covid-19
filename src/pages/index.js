      <div class="person"><p>Nothing in this life is simple or one-sided: of course, the same can be said for even a global pandemic. As many 
        of us are aware, there will be pain and suffering, but where there is a widespread difficulty, it is up to us to unite, as humanity, to grow 
        and get past it. During this quarantine, I've been able to re-examine how I'm spending my time, and build a more healthy lifestyle. I've been working out, 
          eating healthier, sleeping more, and making time for myself, as opposed to enduring the burn as I chased my speeding train of a schedule. I also picked up baking, as if I don't have an influx of sugar in the house anyways.
          I've been able to make time to make music, build websites, and write. I picnic in my backyard, listen to music and watch Netflix on days I decide to 
          relax (for pretty much the first time ever...I know, it's unbelievable, so send me good show recommendations). I've been able to get back to dancing when I can, and singing all the time, simply because I'm at home for most of the day. 
          Listening to the news, I've realized that everyone, no matter in how miniscule of a manner, can have an impact on the current pandemic, which led me to create 
          Defeating COVID-19. Climbing the hill may be difficult, but we can together, and the view from the summit is the ultimate reward: we can unite, share our 
          stories and positivity, and get over this pandemic.</p>

      <div class="person"><p>As a senior graduating high school, going off to college, and just beginning to understand life, COVID has been surprisingly difficult, 
        yet interesting to live through. While I found it hard to keep up with the sudden barrage of assignments during lockdown, it was primarily due to the lack of 
        focus I had (because come on, you're at home all the time, you're not going to do schoolwork for eight hours a day). Yet that lack of focus brought along new 
        things and an influx of time, which though not spent on school, enabled me to explore my hobbies significantly more. I was able to make more music than I was 
        able to before, I was able to develop the most advanced version of Jade, my AI chatbot, and I was able to spend some time taking pictures of local things, 
        walking around my neighborhood for once. Though I've missed out on a lot of opportunities in my social, academic, and professional life because of the pandemic, 
        I won't be one to say that the time I've spent at home wasn't productive or interesting; quite the oppositeand I hope everyone else out there feels that way 
        too. It's tough times, for sure, but we'll all get through it; if not somehow, then sometime.</p>

      <div class="person"><p>I've been trying to keep myself together, although, admittedly, with the combined stress of upcoming exams like SATs, pressure from knowing 
        i'm going to college in two years, and generally not being able to see the people who made me happy every day at school, it's been hard. Having obligations that 
        force me to keep going, like classes, helps get me up in the morning. It's definitely been hard to keep up a healthy lifestyle in quarantine, but hopefully, it 
        will be worth it. I've picked up some old hobbies like dancing, guitar, and singing, and I'm relearning them since I have time anyways, I'm just trying to make 
        sure I don't spend too much time relaxing nor do I work myself until I burn out. Balance is key! And also masks.</p>

      <div class="person"><p>I've been doing pretty well. I've been doing some things that I didn't always have time for before. For example, I've been baking, spending more time with family, walking my dog more, and doing some crafts. I've also been using the time to study for my SAT and tutor people in math. It's also given me some extra time to take care of myself: I've been doing home-workouts, eating healthier, and sleeping more. Like everything in life, COVID-19 has had some positive and negative effects for me. On the positive side, it's given me some extra free time and given me a little break from a busy schedule. Some of the negative effects include not being able to go to school in person, losing in-person contact with others, and canceling some events I was looking forward to. I'm starting to get bored of staying home, and I'm especially sad that my last year of high school won't be in-person. I miss seeing my friends and teachers at school, and just getting out of the house more. But, even though I missed out on some opportunities, I've still been staying optimistic about the future. We're all in the same boat, and we'll all get through this together.</p>

Although I’ve been quite busy each day, I still try to find the time to read books as I know I'll be too busy later on once school starts. I try to view this quarantine to be a self-healing experience where I have more time to start new hobbies and reflect on myself, especially with less interaction with others.</p>
